						Where do I see myself in one year?

       		Asking this question, most people would probably write about their success at work. However, I would just partly agree with them. 
       		Frankly speaking, imagining myself in 2017 is rather difficult because I am not a dreamy kind of person. Furthermore, 
	I consider myself as down-to-earth and I try to be more realistic and just do what I can to become a better person than I am right now. 
       		In my opinion, the most important part in our career is self-education because IT is developing minute by minute and going 
	forward fast, so you have no option, but to keep up with it. Although, we are talking about a year, for IT it is quite a big period. 
	Therefore, I want to train my software skills on cdp program and become a middle developer during this year.
       		Secondly, for every software developer communication skills are as vital as software skills. My whole life I have wanted to speak
	English fluently and now, that I have such opportunity, I want to improve my level. 
       		Finally, I want to travel more, see how the people of other cultures live, experience new food, music, movies etc.  Therefore, 
	in one year I want to visit Europe and especially India because this country has always attracted me by their traditions and their way of life.
       		Overall, I want to grow not only as a software developer, but also to become a more broad-minded person.
